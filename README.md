# sidekiq-global_id

A simple Sidekiq middleware that allows you to transparently [de]serialize GlobalID-compatible objects as GlobalIDs. The benefit of this is that you can express your background jobs just like you do the rest of your code. No need to remember how you need to send them to Redis!

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'sidekiq-global_id'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install sidekiq-global_id

## Usage

Sidekiq has [a middleware system](https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/wiki/Middleware) that allows you to tap into the behavior of both sending jobs to the background queue and pulling them off of the queue. In Sidekiq terminology, these are the _client_ and the _server_.

sidekiq-global_id uses both a client middleware and a server middleware. The client middleware takes arguments from `.perform_async` and serializes any GlobalID-compatible object as a GlobalID before pushing the job into Redis. The server middleware does the reverse: it deserializes any GlobalID that it sees into the object represented by that GlobalID.

Sidekiq has two middleware chains, one for the client and one for the server. In order to use sidekiq-global_id, you must add both the client and server middleware to their appropriate chain. That looks like the following:

``` ruby
# in config/initializers/sidekiq.rb or another configuration file

require "sidekiq/global_id"

Sidekiq.client_middleware do |chain|
  chain.add Sidekiq::GlobalID::ClientMiddleware
end

Sidekiq.server_middleware do |chain|
  chain.add Sidekiq::GlobalID::ServerMiddleware
end
```

Sidekiq middleware chains, like Rack middleware stacks, are order-dependent. If you use other middleware and cannot afford to have the job arguments [de]serialized differently for some reason (e.g. instrumentation or logging), you'll need to keep the order of your middleware in mind.

To make the [de]serialization the first thing that happens after you call `.perform_async` or Sidekiq pulls a job off the queue, you can use `Sidekiq::Middleware::Chain#prepend` to push the middleware to the top of the chain.

The chains also have `#insert_before` and `#insert_after` so think about when the client or server should [de]serialize the arguments.

## Supported Ruby Versions

This library aims to support and is [tested against][actions] the following Ruby versions:

* Ruby 2.6
* Ruby 2.7
* Ruby 3.0
* JRuby 9.2
* JRuby 9.3

If something doesn't work on one of these versions, it's a bug.

This library may inadvertently work (or seem to work) on other Ruby versions, however, we only support the versions listed above.

If you would like this library to support another Ruby version or implementation, you may volunteer to be a maintainer. Being a maintainer entails making sure all tests run and pass on that implementation. When something breaks on your implementation, you will be responsible for providing patches in a timely fashion. If critical issues for a particular implementation exist at the time of a major release, we may drop support for that Ruby version.

## Versioning

This library aims to adhere to [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0][semver]. Report violations of this scheme as bugs. Specifically, if we release a minor or patch version that breaks backward compatibility, we will immediately yank that version and/or immediately release a new version that restores compatibility. We will only introduce breaking changes to the public API with new major versions after 1.0. As a result of this policy, you can (and should) specify a dependency on this gem using the [Pessimistic Version Constraint][pessimistic] with two digits of precision. For example:

    spec.add_dependency "ksuid", "~> 0.1"

[pessimistic]: http://guides.rubygems.org/patterns/#pessimistic-version-constraint
[semver]: http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html
